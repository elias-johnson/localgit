Localgit is local version control.

The goal of this project localgit is to have all of the
functionality of git, but instead of working
with a remote server, it will instead work with a local
location on your machine.

The location that localgit will push to by default is
a folder that it will generate in your home directory.

I'm sure there is already a tool out there that does this.
You can also do this using git already. The purpose
of this project is to build a lightweight tool that allows
for redundancy while building personal projects on your
local machine.
